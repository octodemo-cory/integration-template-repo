# Integration Actions Template

This is a repository template that comes with pre-configured GitHub Actions that
* [Sends Webhooks to Jenkins](.github/workflows/jenkins_trigger.yml)
* [Sends Notifications to Slack](.github/workflows/slack_notify.yml)

Any repository that will use this template as its base will automatically get those workflows enabled. It can be used as a show case on how Open and Inner Source best practices (like welcoming new contributors) as well as bootstrapping project boards can be "codified" and reused and constantly improved as part of a repository template.
